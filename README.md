# Visuo server

This is the source code of a simplified version of the server developed for the VISUO project between the Nanyang Technological University, the Advanced Digital Sciences Center and the National Metrology Centre (Singapore). It collects and stores data from sky imagers, weather stations and radiosondes, and provides a web interface for visualizing and downloading the data behind a login mechanism. It is developed in python using the [django web framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/). Visualizations are coded in javascript using [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) and the [Google Maps JavaScript Api](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/).

A sample deployment is provided here (username: `demo`, password: `demodemo`): http://visuo.pythonanywhere.com/

## Web interface

The interface is composed of three pages:
- **Data visualization**: plots graphs of weather and radiosonde data on a daily basis and interactively plots the sky pictures captured throughout that day on a map.
- **Sky pictures**: filters and lists images captured by the sky imagers.
- **Data downloads**: filters and used to download weather or radiosonde data in excel or matlab formats.

The django admin console (`[base url]/admin`) is also available for the admin user to manage users and the database.

## Organization of the source code

The source code is organized in several django apps:
- **accounts**: extends the djando admin login system to provides login pages for the web application
- **api**: REST apis for uploading data (sky pictures and weather measurements)
- **data**: contains the models for creating the database for all devices and measurements
- **downloads**: generates the download page
- **picture_browser**: generates the sky images browsing page
- **visualization**: generates the interactive data visualization page

The required packages are listed under `requirements.txt`.

## Installation

The source code should be deployed as a standard django web app (including initializing the database, creating the superuser, serving static and media files, ...). Please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/howto/deployment/). Choose database and media files storage strategies which scale with the amount of data that the app should store.

The following steps are also required:
- We use [django-bower](https://django-bower.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to manage javascript packages. Run `./manage.py bower install` to download the dependencies.
- [Get a Google Maps Api key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) and include it in the `visuo-open-source/settings.py` file.
- We use [Alligator](http://alligator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to deal with offline tasks. Choose a queue backend and configure it according to http://alligator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html.

The superuser might use the django admin console at (`[base url]/admin`) to create multiple accounts for several users.

## Adding devices

Devices can upload their latest measurements to the server in real time over the internet using a REST api. Devices should be declared to the server via the admin console. First, create a new user under the *Authentication and authorization* section. Provide a username and a password for the device user account. Then add a token for the user account that you just created in the *Auth Token* section. It will be used to authenticate the device. Then add a new *Measuring device* instance under the *Data* section. Choose the device type (Whole Sky Imager, Weather Station or Radiosonde), provide a name and the location, and select the username you just created.

### Sky imagers

Images captured by sky imagers can be imported in two different ways:
- A batch upload function can be executed on the server itself by calling `.\manage.py import_images --folder [the local folder where the images to be imported are stored] --device [name of the sky imager as created above]`.
- A REST api at `[base url]/api/skypicture/` can be used to upload an image via a POST. The request needs to be authenticated, either using the token or the user account of the respective sky imager. A sample script which runs on a single board computer in our custom-made whole sky imagers is provided at `scripts/send_sky_imager.py`. It controls the camera, captures images at regular intervals using the *gphoto* library and sends them to the server using the REST api.

### Weather stations

We use [Davis Vantage Pro 2](http://www.davisnet.com/solution/vantage-pro2/) weather stations. They upload their data in similar ways:
- A script importing a (csv based) archive file generated by *WeatherLink* can be called with `.\manage.py import_weather --file [local path to the archive file] --device [name of the weather station as created above]`. The code (at `data\management\commands\import_weather.py`) could be modified to reflect different storage schemes.
- A REST api at `[base url]/api/weathermeasurement/` can be invoked to upload a single measurement via a POST. The request also needs to be authenticated by the respective weather station user account. A sample script which runs on the weather station PC is provided at `scripts\read_vantage_pro_2.py`. It reads the latest measurements from *WeatherLink* (.wlk binary files) in a continuous loop and sends them to the server.

### Radiosondes

Importing radiosonde measurements follows a different approach. We use the [database maintained by the University of Wyoming](http://weather.uwyo.edu/upperair/sounding.html) to gather the data. This project only supports a single radiosonde launch location, which should be informed by writing the station number into the `visuo-open-source/settings.py` file. Executing `.\manage.py download_radiosonde --start-date [YYYY-mm-dd] --end-date [YYYY-mm-dd]` download the data between the provided dates. Calling the same script without arguments (`.\manage.py download_radiosonde`) downloads the latest data available. Use a *cron* job on the server to invoke this script twice a day in order to automatically download the measurements for all new radiosonde launches.
